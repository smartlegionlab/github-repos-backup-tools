## Help:

> ATTENTION! Before running the application, you must generate an ssh key for GitHub on your system and add it to your GitHub account.

> You can use a ready-made tool: [github-ssh-key](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/github-ssh-key/) or:

- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@gmail.com"` Replace with your email.
- `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

Copy the key from the `/home/name/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` file and add it to your GitHub account.
- View and copy the key: `cat /home/name/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- [Link to adding a key to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)

- `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_host`
- `ssh -T git@github.com`

The check should be successful.

- `cd ~`
- [Download project in HOME dir](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/github_repos_backup_tools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) or: `wget -P https://github.com/smartlegionlab/github_repos_backup_tools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip` 
- Create a folder "github_repos_backup_tools" and unzip the archive with the project into it. For example: `unzip master.zip -d github_repos_backup_tools`.
- Go to your project folder. Or: `cd github_repos_backup_tools`
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create file .env or `echo -e "GITHUB_API_TOKEN=TOKEN\nGITHUB_NAME=USERNAME" > .env`
- Add keys and values to the file, where the value are your GitHub api token and GitHub username:

> How to generate a token? [Follow the link and create Personal access tokens (classic)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new). Press 'Generate new token'. Select "repo", select "gist", generate and copy the token.
