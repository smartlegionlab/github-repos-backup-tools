## Help:

> ATTENTION! Before running the application, you must generate an ssh key 
> for GitHub on your system and add it to your GitHub account.

> You can use a ready-made tool: [github-ssh-key](https://github.com/smartlegionlab/github-ssh-key/) or:

- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@gmail.com"` Replace with your email.
- `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

Copy the key from the `/home/name/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` file and add it to your GitHub account.
- View and copy the key: `cat /home/name/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`
- [Link to adding a key to GitHub](https://github.com/settings/keys)

- `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_host`
- `ssh -T git@github.com`

The check should be successful.
