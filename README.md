## Help:

> ATTENTION! Before running the application, you must generate an ssh key for GitHub on your system and add it to your GitHub account.

- `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@gmail.com"` Replace with your email
- `eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"`
- `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`

Copy the key from the `.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` file and add it to your GitHub account.

- `ssh -T git@github.com`
- `ssh-keyscan github.com >> ~/.ssh/known_host`

The check should be successful.

- Download project.
- Unzip the project.
- Go to your project folder.
- `python -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Create file .env
- Add keys and values to the file, where the value are your GitHub api token and GitHub username:

```python
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=TOKEN
GITHUB_NAME=USERNAME
```
- `python app.py`
