## 🖥 System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8+ (standard library only, no external dependencies)
- **Git**: 2.20+
- **Storage**: depends on repository sizes
- **Network**: stable internet connection

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smartlegionlab/github-repos-backup-tools.git
cd github-repos-backup-tools
```

### 2. First Run
```bash
python app.py -r
```
On first run, the program will ask for your GitHub token and save it.

### 3. Get GitHub Token
1. Go to [GitHub Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new)
2. Select permissions:
   - ✅ `repo` (full repository access)
   - ✅ `read:org` (access to organization repositories)
3. Generate and copy the token

## 💻 Usage

### Basic Commands
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `-r` | Clone/update repositories |
| `-t` | Update token (delete old and request new) |
| `--no-archive` | Disable archive creation (archive is created by default) |
| `--timeout N` | Timeout for Git operations in seconds (default: 30) |
| `--all-branches` | Enable full branch synchronization (slower, clones ALL branches) |

### Power Management
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `--shutdown` | Shutdown computer after completion |
| `--reboot` | Reboot computer after completion |

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Fast mode - only default branch (DEFAULT)
python app.py -r

# Full mode - ALL branches (slower but complete)
python app.py -r --all-branches

# Backup without archive
python app.py -r --no-archive

# With increased timeout
python app.py -r --timeout 60

# Update token
python app.py -t

# Backup with shutdown
python app.py -r --shutdown
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Operation Modes

#### Fast Mode (Default) - `python app.py -r`
| Action | When it happens | What it does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **CLONE** | New repository | Full clone (all branches on first clone) |
| **PULL** | Has changes | Updates only code in current branch |
| **SKIP** | No changes | Skips the repository |

#### Full Mode - `python app.py -r --all-branches`
| Action | When it happens | What it does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **CLONE** | New repository | Full clone (all branches) |
| **PULL** | Has changes | Updates code + all branches |
| **SYNC** | No changes | Only syncs branches (fetch + create local branches) |
| **CLONE (recover)** | Fetch failed | Re-clones the repository |

### Status Meanings in Logs:

| Status | Mode | Meaning |
|--------|------|---------|
| **CLONE** | Both | New repository - full clone |
| **PULL** | Fast | Code update (current branch only) |
| **PULL** | Full | Code + all branches update |
| **SKIP** | Fast | Skipped - no changes |
| **SYNC** | Full | Branch sync only - code hasn't changed |
| **CLONE (recover)** | Full | Re-clone on error |

### User Information Export

Each run saves your GitHub profile information to `user_info.json`:
- Login, name, email, bio
- Public/private repository counts
- Followers and following
- Account creation and update timestamps
- Last backup timestamp

### Backup Organization

All backup artifacts are neatly organized:
- **JSON reports** - `backups/backup_report_*.json`
- **ZIP archives** - `backups/username_github_backup_*.zip`

This keeps your user folder clean and makes it easy to find all backups.

### Update Logic

1. **Quick check**: compare local commit date with GitHub pushed_at
2. **If difference > 5 minutes**: compare actual commit hashes via `ls-remote`
3. **If hashes differ**: perform `git pull`
4. **After pull**: verify repository health with `git rev-parse HEAD`
5. **If corrupted**: automatic re-clone with retries

### Branch Synchronization (Full Mode with `--all-branches`)

- **CLONE**: creates local branches for all remote branches
- **PULL**: fetches all branches + updates code + creates new branches
- **SYNC**: fetches all branches + creates new branches + prunes deleted ones
- **Pruning**: automatically removes local branches deleted on remote

### Fast Mode (Default, without `--all-branches`)

- **CLONE**: clones all branches (first time only)
- **PULL**: updates only the current branch
- **SKIP**: if no changes detected, no operation performed
- **No branch sync after clone**: significantly faster for large repositories with many branches

## 🔒 Security

- Token stored in `~/github_backup_repos_tools/[username]/config.json`
- Uses HTTPS with token in URL (not transmitted in plain text)
- Path traversal attack protection
- No telemetry or third-party data transmission
- Token can be updated with `-t` command
- Archives contain ONLY repositories, no tokens or configs

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- **Gists not supported** - utility works with repositories only
- **Git required** - must be installed on the system
- **Token permissions** - requires `repo` and `read:org`

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

**Q: Authentication fails?**  
A: Verify token has `repo` and `read:org` permissions. Use `-t` to update.

**Q: Clone timeout?**  
A: Increase timeout: `--timeout 60`

**Q: Where is token stored?**  
A: In `~/github_backup_repos_tools/[username]/config.json`

**Q: Where are backups stored?**  
A: All archives and reports are in `~/github_backup_repos_tools/[username]/backups/`

**Q: What's in user_info.json?**  
A: Your GitHub profile information - login, name, email, repo counts, followers, etc.

**Q: How to cancel scheduled shutdown?**  
A: `shutdown -c` (Linux/macOS) or `shutdown /a` (Windows)

**Q: Why do I see SKIP for some repos?**  
A: In Fast Mode, repos without changes are skipped to save time.

**Q: What's the difference between SYNC and PULL in Full Mode?**  
A: PULL updates code + branches, SYNC only syncs branches (when code hasn't changed).

## 🚀 What's New in v1.6.0

- ✅ **User profile export** - saves GitHub user info to `user_info.json`
- ✅ **Organized backups** - all archives and reports in `backups/` folder
- ✅ **Cleaner archives** - ZIP contains only repositories, no configs or tokens
- ✅ **Improved structure** - `~/github_backup_repos_tools/[username]/backups/`
- ✅ **Branch pruning** - automatically removes local branches deleted on remote
- ✅ **No SSH required** - uses only HTTPS with token authentication
- ✅ **Smart update** - two-stage verification (date + hash) before pull
- ✅ **Health checks** - verifies repository integrity after each operation
- ✅ **Automatic recovery** - re-clones corrupted repositories
- ✅ **Exponential backoff** - up to 5 retries with increasing delays
- ✅ **Two operation modes** - Fast (default) and Full (--all-branches)
- ✅ **SKIP status** - clearly shows when repos are skipped (Fast Mode)
- ✅ **SYNC status** - shows branch-only sync (Full Mode)

### Two Operation Modes

| Mode | Command | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|---------|----------|----------|
| **Fast (Default)** | `python app.py -r` | Code only, default branch after clone | Quick daily sync |
| **Full** | `python app.py -r --all-branches` | Full backup with ALL branches + sync | Complete backup |

### Performance Comparison
- **Fast mode (Default)**: ~1-2 seconds per repository (SKIP when no changes)
- **Full mode**: ~3-5 seconds per repository (always syncs branches)
- **SKIP** (no changes): virtually instant
